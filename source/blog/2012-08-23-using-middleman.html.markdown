I have been wanting to decouple myself from one of the many popular blogging CMS that is out there, most recently with wordpress. I looked around and decided on [Middleman](http://www.middlemanapp.com). One of the reasons that I wanted to move away from a CMS is that I wanted complete control of the HTML markup, CSS, and Javascript. I wanted to build a site with my own folder structure using the tools that I like to use. CMS are handy for a lot of people that want something fast and simple, and if they don't want/know how to code their own.

##Why Middleman?
Middleman makes it easy to get up and running with a few commands on the old command line. It is bundled as a gem, so just fire up your preferred command line application and type `gem install middleman` you can find a good [getting started guide](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/welcome/) and more on the [middleman site](http://middlemanapp.com).

##Comment system
Wordpress and other blog CMS usually have some sort of commenting built in which is what is desired a lot for a blog. This isn't necessarily	 a win anymore with services out there like [disqus](http://disqus.com/) or [livefyre](http://www.livefyre.com/) that provide this service with just a few lines of javascript added to your page. I went with [disqus](http://disqus.com/) because I am familiar with it and was actually using it in my wordpress build.

##What about hosting?
I was also tired of paying every month/year for a service that I didn't really need. I chose to host on [github](http://www.github.com) as a [github page](http://pages.github.com/). There you can easily create a page and use one of their pre-defined templates, or upload your own manual pages.

##I am free
I am now free of a bulky CMS and hosting costs. I get to use what I want and how I want it. This makes me happy :)
