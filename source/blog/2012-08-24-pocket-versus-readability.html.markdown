[@erondu](http://www.twitter.com/erondu) posed the question last night on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Readability or Pocket</p>&mdash; Jared Erondu (@erondu) <a href="https://twitter.com/erondu/status/238871995591294976" data-datetime="2012-08-24T05:34:56+00:00">August 24, 2012</a></blockquote>

I use a *read it later* type of service when I am reading Twitter on my iPhone and I want to save an article that somebody links to, but I don't have time to read it, nor do I enjoy reading long articles on my phone. These *read it later* services are great for this type of use as well as organizing saved links and interesting articles. I am going to compare these two services from what I have experienced with them.

##Pocket
**Full disclosure:** I have been a [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com) user for a long time.

I really enjoy the tight integration with the Twitter iOS app's "Read Later" setting. I can easily tap "Read Later" in Twitter and it is immediately sent to my Pocket queue. For apps that don't integrate with the service, Pocket offers an [email service](http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/482759) that allows you to send any link via email.

For use on the web, the chrome add-on is great, you can either click the toolbar icon, or right click and select the contextual menu "save to Pocket" item.

The one drawback of Pocket is the web app. I tisn't very pretty, there are some cluncky design elements and the archiving/tagging functionality is hard to find and use.

###pros
* Integrated with the twitter iOS app "Read Later" function.
* Chrome add-on adds "save to pocket"" in the contextual menu.

###cons
* The web app isn't very pretty.
* You can't share to twitter directly from the web app.
* Tagging in the web app is hard to find and filter.

##Readability
I have wanted to give [Readability](http://www.readability.com) a try since I started using pocket. This challenge gave me the opportunity to sign up, download the app, and give it a go.

Immediately I notice the clean and elegant design of the website and also the iOS app. I think I that I would love to read articles here. First thing I do is open Twitter on my iPhone and go to the settings, specifically the "Read Later" service. Uh oh, There are only options for [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) and [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com). Not a good start. They too offer an email service, so I add my personal [Readability email address](http://www.readability.com/account/email), tap the Mail link button in Twitter and send it to Readability. I open Readability andâ€¦ nothing. I asked Readability about this on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="239011907074404352"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pettpett"><s>@</s><b>pettpett</b></a> Do the links you're sending have http:// at the front of them? And we'd love it if Twitter integrated Readability into their app.</p>&mdash; Readability (@readability) <a href="https://twitter.com/readability/status/239015354389643264" data-datetime="2012-08-24T15:04:35+00:00">August 24, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, I can't easily send links from Twitter on iOS to Readability, very unfortunate.

I gave their chrome add-on a try, it is nice, but you have to click the button in the toolbar and then select "Read Later".

###pros
* Looks fantastic.

###cons
* Not integrated with the Twitter iOS app.
* Emailing a link from Twitter iOS app strips the http:// and Readabilities email feature doesn't support links without the protocol.


##Summary
For my personal use. I will stick with [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com). It offers me what I need, a simple way to save links from my phone and the web. Give each of them a try and find which one better suits your needs.
